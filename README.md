# The Agentic AI Weekend

A two-day, hands-on workshop for three people. No slides beyond a whiteboard, no
frameworks until you've built the thing by hand.

## The one idea

Everything in this workshop is a variation on a single sentence:

> **An agent is a while-loop around a model that can call functions.**

Skills, RAG, MCP, memory, multi-agent orchestration — all of it is plumbing
bolted onto that loop. If you leave the weekend genuinely believing that
sentence, and having written the loop yourself, the entire field stops looking
like magic and starts looking like software.

## Who this is for

| | Background | What they get out of it |
|---|---|---|
| **Host** | Runs the labs, owns the GPU | A repeatable workshop you can run again |
| **Friend 1** | MSc in AI, light on practice | Theory grounded in running code, plus a portfolio project scoped and started |
| **Friend 2** | Cloud/infra background | A working mental model, plus an AI-platform-engineering angle for the job market |

They are complementary. **Pair them at one machine for most labs** and let each
be the expert for half the day. Friend 1 explains why the attention mechanism
means context is expensive; Friend 2 explains why you'd never run that in
production without a circuit breaker. Both are right.

## The ladder

Each lab is visibly one small step up from the last. Don't skip rungs — the
whole design depends on the steps feeling small.

```

Every lab folder has its own `README.md` with: **goal → steps → expected output
→ if it breaks**. Working solutions live on the `solutions` branch.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ai-agents-weekend
cd ai-agents-weekend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # then paste your API key into .env
python check_setup.py
```

If `check_setup.py` prints all green, you're ready. If it doesn't, fix it
**before** the weekend starts. Two hours lost to CUDA drivers on Saturday
morning kills the whole event.

## A note on models

The labs deliberately use **two different kinds of model**:

- **Local models on the GPU** (Lab 1, and comparisons throughout) — for
  understanding inference economics, VRAM, quantisation, and throughput.
- **A frontier API model** (Labs 2–8) — for the agentic work.

This split is intentional and worth explaining out loud on Saturday morning.
Small local models in the 8B range are genuinely unreliable at multi-step tool
calling. If you build the agent labs on them you will spend the weekend
debugging malformed JSON instead of learning agentic patterns. Lab 1 makes that
failure mode visible on purpose, and then we move on.
